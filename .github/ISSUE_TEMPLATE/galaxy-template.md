- [ ] tp - check baseline of single-dish image
- [ ]  tp - check for artefacts in single-dish image

- [ ] 7m - check residual map 
- [ ] 7m - check baseline of 7m image (i.e. in continuum subtraction okay?)
- [ ] 7m - check for negative bowls in 7m image
- [ ] 7m - check for artefacts in 7m image (linear features in map, large fluxes etc)

- [ ] 7m+tp - check baseline of 7m image (i.e. in continuum subtraction okay?)
- [ ] 7m+tp - check for negative bowls in 7m image
- [ ] 7m+tp - check for artefacts in 7m image (linear features in map, large fluxes etc)
- [ ] 7m+tp - compare to the single dish image (fluxes okay?) 

- [ ] *Dataset science ready?*
