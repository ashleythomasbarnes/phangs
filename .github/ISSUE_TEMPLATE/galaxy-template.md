[ ] tp - check baseline of single-dish image
[ ] tp - check for artefacts in single-dish image

[ ] 7m - check residual map 
[ ] 7m - check baseline of 7m image (i.e. in continuum subtraction okay?)
[ ] 7m - check for negative bowls in 7m image
[ ] 7m - check for artefacts in 7m image (linear features in map, large fluxes etc)

[ ] 7m+tp - check baseline of 7m image (i.e. in continuum subtraction okay?)
[ ] 7m+tp - check for negative bowls in 7m image
[ ] 7m+tp - check for artefacts in 7m image (linear features in map, large fluxes etc)
[ ] 7m+tp - compare to the single dish image (fluxes okay?)
